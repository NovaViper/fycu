# Things to work on

- ## Iron out buggy
- Partial matching keeps happening with the string match regexes
- ## Setup Abbreviation support
  Partially implemented but still very buggy. Fish keeps partial matching strings
  even though I don't want it to do so.. figuring that part out.
- ## Setup custom messages
  Allow users to setup custom reminder messages
- ## Hardcore move
  This may not get implemented at all, as apparently it is currently impossible to
  stop fish commands from executing. Based on what is noted [here](https://github.com/paysonwallach/fish-you-should-use/blob/master/TODO.md#hardcore-mode)
