# Things to work on

- ## Iron out buggy
- Currently, fish can't detect an Abbreviations expanded occurred; need to retool
  the abbrev function, so it's turned off for now with `FYCU_ENABLE_ABBR`
- ## Setup custom messages
  Allow users to setup custom reminder messages
- ## Hardcore move
  This may not get implemented at all, as apparently it is currently impossible to
  stop fish commands from executing. Based on what is noted [here](https://github.com/paysonwallach/fish-you-should-use/blob/master/TODO.md#hardcore-mode)
